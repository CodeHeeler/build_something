# Build Something (Useless)

Our objective was to choose anything and build it.  This is in part to get us used to picking something on our own in preparation for our pitches the following week, but also a chance to explore things we might enjoy or that we want to practice.

My something useless is a game.  I love old school pixelated games and so I set out to learn what I could of pygame in the allotted time.

So far, you can see a bouncing ball by cloning the directory and running bounce.py

You can also see a random set of resources created in a map to be used with a 2D-MineCraft style game later by running my_first_game.py
